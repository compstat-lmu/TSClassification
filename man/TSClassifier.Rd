\title{Time Seriess Classifier}
\format{An object of class \code{R6ClassGenerator} of length 24.}
\usage{
TSClassifier
}
\arguments{
\item{classifier}{[`character(1)`] \cr
Classifier to use, see `?tsc_classifiers` for a list of available classifiers.}

\item{model_path}{[`character(1)`] \cr
Path to store the resulting model to. Default `NULL` creates a temporary file.}
}
\description{
Allows training and predicting on time-series classification data.
Internally writes the data to an `.arff` file and reads it from
the command line in the Java Virtual Machine.
In some cases, the memory of the JVM is not sufficient.
In this case, the memory for the JVM can be set to 2 GB by setting
`options(java.options = "-Xmx2048m")` before loading the package.
}
\details{
Expects the data to either be a `data.frame` or a `character` path to a
data set in the '.arff' format. In case a 'data.frame' is provided, the
data is saved to '.$model_path' and then read into the JVM from there.
The target variable's name is assumed to be 'target'.

Members:
  - train(data, par_vals): Delegates to [`train_tsc`]
  - predict(newdata):      Delegates to [`predict_tsc`]
  - cleanup():             Remove saved model files.
