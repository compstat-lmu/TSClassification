Description:
    A package that exposes many state-of-the-art classifiers for time-series classification.
    A large number of time-series classifiers have been implemented in
    Java by Bagnall et al. (2018) for a benchmark study "The Great Time Series Classification Bake Off".
    This package interfaces an adapted version of implementations provided by Bagnall et al., in order
    to make algorithms available to a wider audience.
