# Summary
Time series classification problems has extensively studied due to its wide range of applications, and the release of UCR time series archive stimulate the growth of publications proposing time series classification algorithms in this field. At least one thousand published papers made use of at least one dataset from archive.[1] However, due the discrepency of the dataset and different framework where the algorithms implemented, it is difficult to compare different algorithms.To address these problems, 18 different TSC algorithms in Java, integrated with the WEKA toolkit have been implemented.[2]
